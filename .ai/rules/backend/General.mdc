## General PHP & Laravel Conventions
- This project uses **PHP 8.4**.
- Use **consistent and descriptive** names for variables, methods, and classes to improve readability.
- Follow Laravel's conventions:
  - **Singular** for models (e.g., `User.php`).
  - **Plural** for controllers managing models (e.g., `UsersController.php`).
- For singular functionalities like registration or dashboards, use a singular controller name (e.g., `RegisterController`, `DashboardController`).
- Naming conventions:
  - **PascalCase** for class names.
  - **camelCase** for method names.
  - **snake_case** for database columns.
- **Avoid repeating plain string values** (e.g., statuses). Use an Enum instead, placed in `app\Enums`.
- Prefer `match()` over `switch()` for better readability and maintainability.
- Do **not** install or add Composer packages without prior approval.
- Do **not** create or modify migrations unrelated to the current task.

## Security
- Prevent **SQL injection vulnerabilities** by always using FormRequests to validate user input.
- Avoid exposing sensitive data in responses.

## Static Code Analysis
- We use **Larastan (`larastan/larastan`)** for static analysis.
- Always run `composer analyse` after adding a new feature.
- Use **Larastan level 9**.
