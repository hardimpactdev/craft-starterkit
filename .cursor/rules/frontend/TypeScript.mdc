## TypeScript Best Practices
- Use TypeScript exclusively; prefer **types** over **interfaces**.
- Avoid `enum`; use `const` objects instead for better tree-shaking.
- Use Vue 3 with TypeScript, leveraging `defineComponent` and `PropType`.
- Always type function arguments and return values.

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, well-structured TypeScript code with accurate, technical examples.
- Use clear, descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Follow a structured file organization:
  - Exported components
  - Composables
  - Helpers
  - Static content
  - Types
- Keep components small and focused, ensuring single responsibility.

## Naming Conventions
- Use **lowercase with dashes** for directories (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).
- Use **PascalCase** for component names (e.g., `AuthWizard.vue`).
- Use **camelCase** for composables (e.g., `useAuthState.ts`).
- Maintain consistency across files and folders.
